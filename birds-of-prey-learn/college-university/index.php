					   <h1>For Colleges &amp; Universities and Their Students</h1>
					   <p class="lead">Whether you are a student or a tutor looking to deepen education with hands-on experiences or real-life subject matter, we're here to help you achieve your goals.</p>
					   <p>We have been providing these kinds of services for many years and our offerings include: Taking work placements from a broad-range of age groups, nationally recognised training &amp; certification, educational college &amp; university visits, partnership with complete courses, and any kind of hands-on experience necessary (such as for the Duke of Edinburgh Award). The characteristics and qualities of birds of prey mean that they suit a wide variety of courses, ranging from the obvious to the not so obvious.</p>
					   <p>We are based in Oxenhope, West Yorkshire, which is near the adjoining borders of North Yorkshire and Lancashire in the UK.</p>

				       <h2 itemprop="name">Work Placements</h2>
					   <div itemprop="description">
				         <p>A student coming here on a work placement can expect:</p>
				         <ul>
				           <li>in-depth, hands-on experience</li>
				           <li>guidance from expert bird-handlers</li>
				           <li>working in a team</li>
				           <li>exposure to more than 60 birds of prey</li>
				           <li>cultivation of career readiness</li>
				           <li>improved prospects</li>
				         </ul>
				         <p>We bring learning to life with plenty of interaction from the animals.</p> 
				         <p>Because we are a small business of only half-a-dozen or so people, a student will also get the benefit of the level of engagement associated with working with the business' entire team. Also, while we can't make any promises -- due to being a small business -- it is not unheard of for students to come back for weekend or summer work.</p>

				         <p>With more than a decade working with a wide variety of birds of prey: Our team are knowledgeable and adept in all experiential aspects of bird of prey care; also health, training, breeding, anatomy, characteristics &amp; qualities etc. In fact, at SMJ Falconry we are certified to deliver nationally recognised training as such.</p> 
				         <p>At college &amp; university level of education, we are aware that tutors, professors and lecturers can often be more knowledgeable than us, when it comes to the detail &amp; the science; <em>especially so</em> in subjects less immediately connected. With this in mind we offer to collaborate with you to provide both the subject matter and to add experiential depth to the learning experience.</p> 
				         <p>Working with students, teachers and tutors is something very familiar to us. Moreover, because our experience covers a broad range of activities with birds of prey (from interactive experience days to film work &amp; photography, wedding ring delivery to pest control, and beyond) we understand that the involvement of our birds of prey is suitable for a wide variety of courses (more about this later).</p>
				         <p>Whatever your interest in having us visit your College or University with our birds of prey, get in touch and we will discuss ideas with you, with a view to preparing something appropriate to your requirements.</p>
