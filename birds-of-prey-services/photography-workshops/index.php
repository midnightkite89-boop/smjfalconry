		  	<p>Birds of prey have always been a favourite with photographers and can be a very challenging subject to photograph, especially in flight. On this session we aim to cover the best use of equipment to get captivating shots of the Birds in natural settings.</p>

			<p>This session will take place with SMJ falconry in the beautiful setting of Oxenhope. The centre is set within natural scenery including photogenic stone walls, hills and fields. With this in mind we will be concentrating on native birds to this wonderful habitat. Our experienced falconer will position and fly the birds to enable the best use of photographic opportunities as well as ensuring the comfort of the Birds.</p>

			<p>So, if youâ€™re new to this type of photography or simply love Birds of Prey, then this is the perfect session for you. The falconer and Wild Arena guide will be on hand all day to ensure you get the best possible pictures from this session and with a small group of just 6 photographers, there will be plenty of time for everyone to get the help they need.</p>

			<p>The session will start with a detailed briefing from your photography guide, how to set up your camera and the proposed running order for the day. This will be decided on the day, depending on weather conditions and availability of Birds</p>
