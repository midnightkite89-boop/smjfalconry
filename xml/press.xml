    <shortdescription>Kate Hall for Horse and Countryside magazine visited us in August this year to do a little article about Bird of Prey Experiences that bird of prey/falconry centres offer. She had the oppertunity to meet all of our birds and she flew Julianne our Hooded Vulture, Willow our Red Kite and Toby one of our Harris Hawks. It was a glorious sunny day and the birds performed beautifully, if you would like to purchase the article and find out more, visit Horse and Countrysides website via the link below.</shortdescription>

We took our Birds to Oakbank School in Keighley as part of the Countryside alliance's Falconry 4 Schools project. This project is free for schools to do as it is funded by the Countryside Alliance and aims to teach students the history of Falconry and about how to care and look after Birds of Prey.</shortdescription>

    <featuredescription>The Bronte Vintage Gathering is a fantastic, well organised country show that takes place in the Cullingworth countryside every year. They have been known to have horses jumping through fire, circus performers and all sorts of other great stuff. We were thrilled to display our birds of prey there too!

    <shortdescription></shortdescription>
    <featuredescription>When we visited Aire View Infant School we took along 6 very different owls, ranging in size from a tiny grey Scops owl all the way up to a huge golden Eagle owl. The children had been learning about nocturnal animals, so one of the things we explained was how you can tell the difference between owls which hunt in the day and those which hunt at night, just by looking into their eyes!</featuredescription>

    <shortdescription></shortdescription>
    <featuredescription>Having a bird or prey fly away from us occasionally comes with the territory. Fortunately it doesn't happen very often... Back in 2013 James' Lanner Falcon, Nekala, decided there might be something more interesting going on elsewhere. Later a resourceful farmer spotted Nekala and, with the help of facebook, found us too and brought her back!</featuredescription>
